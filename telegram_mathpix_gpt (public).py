You should use an appropriate tone, generate relevant ideas, and express them coherently. Additionally, you should use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and use a variety of vocabulary appropriately with clarity and precision.
    Paper 2 (Language Use and Comprehension) will assess your understanding of texts. You should be able to comprehend the overall meaning of the text, show understanding of implied meaning, and analyze text critically. You should also demonstrate your understanding of how contextual use of lexical and grammatical items shape meaning. Lastly, you should illustrate the appropriate use of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary.
